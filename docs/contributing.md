# How To Contribute

Welcome!

## How to...

#### Report a bug or suggest an improvement

Go to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/utz82/bintracker/issues) on Github. If using Github is not an option for you, you can also use the [contact form](https://bintracker.org/contact/).


#### Get started as a new contributor

Have a look at our [TODO List](TODO.md). Any TODO item marked with **[*]** could be a good newcomer's task, given some knowledge in the relevant disciplines.


#### Properly format my code

Check out the [style guide](style-guide.md).


#### Chose a license for my code

All code in Bintracker's core components are under MIT License. If you contribute extensions to the official repository, use a MIT, BSD, Apache, LGPL, or a similar license, or commit your work to the public domain.
