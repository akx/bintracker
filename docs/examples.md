### Evaluate expression and paste result to current module

```scheme
(edit (current 'blockview) 'current 'set (iota 4))
```

This evaluates the expression `(iota 4)` (which returns the list `(0 1 2 3)`) and pastes it into the current selection (if any) or at cursor position of the current blockview (patterns/fx tables/etc).

### Get the command configuration of an MDAL field node

```scheme
(config-get-inode-source-command 'foo (current 'mdef))
```

Returns the source command of the field `foo` in the current MDAL engine definition.

`config-get-inode-source-command` is due to be renamed to `mdef-get-ifield-source-command`.

### Get the contents of a selection

Retrieve the contents of the current selection:

```scheme
(ui-selected-contents (current 'blockview))
```

The contents are returned as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a field node, and the contents of the sublist represent the row values of that node.

Get the contents of a specific area:

```scheme
(ui-selected-contents (current 'blockview) '(0 FOO 4 BAR))
```

This returns the values of the fields FOO to and including BAR, from row 0 to and including 4.
